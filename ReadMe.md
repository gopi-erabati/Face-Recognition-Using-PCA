The main objective of our project is to recognize faces from the collected set of face data using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). We have collected the five pictures of every student and the idea here is to extract few features from the faces with the goal of reducing the number of variables used to represent the faces. In the next step, we divide the faces into two categories of train and test images. But, the problem here is, an image has high dimensionality space (each image is a point in a space of dimension d = MN, M and N being image size) as each pixel is considered as a variable of an image. So, we can reduce the dimensionality by using PCA to simplify recognition problem, which can be considered as the core concept.
